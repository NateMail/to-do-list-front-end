to-do-list-front-end by Nathan Mailhiot

This is my version of a to-do list.

USED IN THIS PROJECT:
HTML5, SCSS, Handlebars, Javascript, JQUERY, JSON, AJAX, Bootstrap

WHAT THIS APP DOES:
This application is a to-do list.  You can create, update, delete and see items
that you add to your own list.

CHALLENGES:
When I first started working on this project I didn't forsee a lot of the small
problems I was going to have.  One of the biggest challenges I had was in the
Bootstrap modal for the update.  The modal wasn't responding at first and then
it was refreshing the page everytime I tried to update an item.  The problem I
was having was in the handlebars.  Since I was not passing the data the correct
way it was resetting the the form which was refreshing the page.  After asking
for some help from colleagues I was able to get it running.  There wasn't many
that many other challenges.

WHAT I WOULD DO IF I HAD MORE TIME:
I would like to go back and add a button that crosses out every item that is
completed.  I'd also like to go back and add some more themes.
